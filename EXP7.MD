### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040037
### AIM: 
For ATM system study its system specifications and report various bugs

### Purpose:
The purpose of this study is to analyze the ATM system software requirements, understand its functionalities, and report potential issues that may impact user experience, functionality, or security.

### Scope:
The scope of this study includes identifying specifications for core ATM functions such as user authentication, cash withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, and transaction history review. It also covers usability, security, and operational constraints.

### Intended Audience:
This document is intended for software developers, system analysts, quality assurance teams, and stakeholders involved in the development and maintenance of ATM systems.

### Product Perspective:
The ATM system serves as a customer-facing interface for banking services. It enables users to perform transactions and access bank services without visiting a physical branch. The system interacts with the bankâ€™s backend server for validation and processing.

### Product Functions:
The ATM system provides the following primary functions:

User Authentication: Validates user credentials using a PIN or biometric authentication.
Balance Inquiry: Allows users to view their account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Enables users to withdraw cash from their account.
Cash Deposit: Allows users to deposit cash into their account.
Funds Transfer: Facilitates the transfer of funds between accounts.
Transaction History: Displays a summary of recent transactions.
Account Settings: Provides options for PIN change, mobile number update, etc.

### Operative Environments:
The ATM application is designed to operate in the following environments:

Operating Systems: Windows or Linux-based operating systems typically used in ATMs.
Hardware: ATMs with card readers, PIN pads, cash dispensers, deposit modules, and display screens.
Network: Secure network connectivity for communication with bank servers.

### Design/implementation constraints:
Limited screen size and user input options on ATMs.
Real-time processing requirements to ensure fast transaction completion.
Robust error handling for hardware failures (e.g., cash dispenser jam).
Compliance with banking standards and security regulations.

### Assumptions and Dependencies: 
The ATM is connected to a stable network for real-time transaction processing.
ATM users have valid bank accounts and bank-issued ATM cards.
All hardware components (e.g., card reader, cash dispenser) function correctly.

### Software interfaces 
User Interface: Touchscreen or physical button interface for user interactions.
Network Interface: Connects with bank servers to process transactions.
Backend System Interface: Retrieves and updates account information.

### Safety requirements: 
The ATM must provide physical security features, such as anti-tampering sensors.
The system should automatically log out after a period of inactivity.
Compliance with safety protocols to protect users from fraud or theft.

### Security requirements: 
Secure PIN encryption during transmission and processing.
End-to-end encryption for all transactions.
The ATM must not display sensitive information like the PIN on the screen.
Protection against unauthorized access and tampering.

### Possible Bugs:
Transaction Errors: Transactions not processed correctly due to network interruptions.
UI Errors: Inconsistent or non-intuitive user interface behavior.
Authentication Bugs: Incorrect handling of PIN inputs (e.g., too many retries allowed).
Balance Mismatch: Incorrect balance displayed due to server synchronization issues.
Receipt Errors: Issues in generating or printing transaction receipts.
Hardware Malfunctions: Errors with the card reader, cash dispenser, or receipt printer.

### Result:
Thus, the ATM system specifications and reporting the various bugs is implemented and output was verified successfully
